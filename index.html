    <h2>Writer. Editor. Book freak.</h1>
    <p>My name is Molly Grab, and I study English and Communications at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I am interested in literature, information storage and archiving, communication law, and, of course, anything to do with Jane Eyre. I hope to pursue my passions through internships and real-world experience in order to determine what change I can make in the world -- eventually.</p>
      <p>My coursework thus far has cultivated my writing, research, presentation, and critical thinking skills. It has also opened my eyes to various world issues that need addressing to which I hope I can someday lend my skills --  unequal access to information and the infringement of free speech are two of the most interesting to me.</p>
      <p>In addition to my studies, I also work as the Copy Chief for <a href="http://www.hawkhillnews.com/">The Hawk Newspaper</a>, the student paper of St. Joe's. I am responsible for editing all of the newspaper's content each week according to Associated Press Style as well as organizing a team of copy editors. Working for a student publication has fostered my interest in writing, editing, digital organization, and first amendment rights, which I hope to incorporte into my future career path. </p>
